# The MLH Hackathon Organizer's Guide

The MLH Hackathon Organizer's Guide is a community initiative to make a student hackathon playbook. 

Follow the playbook and it will walk you through every step of throwing a great hackathon.

You can find the guide [here](http://guide.mlh.io/).

**Disclaimer:** _The Book of Hackathon is never finished. Try everything, contribute your learnings back to the guide with a pull request._

## Getting Started 

The MLH Hackathon Organizer's Guide is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Currently Jekyll is not supported on Windows. 

To get started on OSX after you've cloned this repo run:

    % gem install jekyll
    % jekyll serve

The guide will now be running locally on port 4000. For more information checkout the [jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
