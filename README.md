# The Book of Hackathon

The Book of Hackathon is an open-source initiative to make a hackathon playbook. 

Follow the playbook and it will walk you through every step of throwing a great hackathon.

The Book of Hackathon is never finished. Try new things. As you discover strategies that work better, give back to the community by sending us a pull request.
