# Building a team

  

It’s nearly always a great idea to throw a hackathon. The hard part is actually doing it right.

  

Imagine you are building a startup.

  

**Hackers are your users, sponsors are your paying customers, and _your team is everything._**

  

The team will define what your hackathon will look like in a few months. Don’t just bring on the top hackers you know. Build a diverse team of the best people you know, because you are going to need it. 

  

They will be on the ground with you for an entire weekend as you try to keep the event from falling apart on close to zero sleep. When shit hits the fan and the wifi goes down at 3am on Sunday, they will have your back as you try to keep an army of hungry hackers calm.

  

## Snipe the best talent

**_If you’re waiting for your team to come to you, you’re doing it wrong._**

  

Applications are overrated. Identify the best talent and go after them. 

  

They won’t come to you, especially if they aren’t hackers. Make it as public as possible that the organizing team doesn’t discriminate based on technical ability. 

  

Ask the heads of other organizations who their best people are and go after them. Ask professors who their favorite students are. Go after them.

  

    Good Hacker != Good Hackathon Organizer 

  

## Tom Sawyering

[The adventures of Tom Sawyer](http://www.pbs.org/marktwain/learnmore/writings_tom.html) begin with him painting a fence. When his friends go up to ask him what he’s doing, he’s painting so enthusiastically that he doesn’t even notice them there. Next thing you know, they are offering to pay him to paint the fence.

  

Throwing a hackathon is play, not work. You have to do it because you love it. 

  

The teams that organize the best hackathons love what they are doing. 

  

This will be the pillar of your recruiting efforts.

  

Every time someone asks you what you’re doing you have an opportunity to bring them onto the team. If your answer is “work” you should reevaluate why you’re throwing the hackathon.

  

## Your 1 Minute Pitch: Sell the vision 
**_People don’t want to throw a hackathon; they want to change the world._**

  

In 1 minute, you should be able to convince just about anyone that hackathons can change the world. Within 2 minutes, they should be begging to get involved.

  

You’ll have to iterate on this pitch a ton to make it work, but it’s totally doable. If you haven’t already, read [How to Win Friends & Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034) and [Pitching Hacks](http://venturehacks.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Pitching-Hacks.pdf).

  

**Pitch all the time.** Start with your own story and work from there to your more radical vision for how the hackathon will change people’s lives forever.

  

Several months before the first MHacks, we took a trip to rally hackers at the major engineering universities in the Midwest. They definitely thought we were insane, but by the time we got back to Ann Arbor, we had hundreds of signups and an MHacks organizer at every school.

  

_If you don’t sound crazy when you’re giving the pitch, you’re probably not thinking big enough._ 

  

The key is to balance the crazy vision with really actionable steps to get there. 

  

The moment they ask “how can I help?” or “how do I get involved?” you should respond with something extremely tangible that they can do right away. 

  

Whether that’s making an introduction, adding a potential sponsor to the spreadsheet, or actually helping with the hackathon itself. Give them something concrete to do right away.

  

It sounds counter-intuitive but going back to the Tom Sawyer story, you’re actually making them like your hackathon more if you give them an easy way to help. 

  

Add them to an organizing Facebook Group or Slack on the spot. Don’t make people apply to the team; invite them to join it right away. Make them feel like they are part of something big. 

  

As soon as they hit the group or slack, it should be painstakingly clear where they can jump in and help. If you don’t make them feel like a part of the team right away, you lose the momentum, the excitement they had after that pitch, and you may never have another opportunity to bring them back on.

  

**Make it so easy to help that people are begging to do so.** 

  

## Distribute ownership.

**_You want everyone on your team._**

  

That doesn’t necessarily mean that they will actually take on a major responsibility; it means they have a vested interest in your hackathon’s success. You want as many people to feel ownership as possible. Don’t limit this to students at your school. You want everybody.

  

**As soon as you bring someone on, give them a title.** 

    Example: “MHacks Organizer” or “MHacks Advisor” 

  

These are free to give out and you’ll be surprised how valuable they are to people. **By simply adding someone to the group, telling them how to help, and giving them a title, you can make just about anyone feel like they are part of the team.**

  

People with buy-in generally have no problem making you intros. These intros will be crucial to the two biggest bottlenecks of your hackathon: fundraising and, of course, recruiting.

  

## Everyone on the team is always recruiting

**Everyone on your team should always be recruiting the best people they know.** Every time you onboard someone, ask who else they’d love to work with.  At every meeting, emphasize that the team is everything and spend at least a few minutes on recruiting strategies.

  

**Everyone on the team should have their own effective 1-minute pitch ASAP.** If people aren’t there yet, get them there. Encourage everyone on the team to be pitching all the time.

  

## Convince people to do things they aren’t qualified to do. 

**Experience is overrated** -- most of what you’ll be doing will be new anyways. Find the most open-minded, passionate, hardest-working people around. 

  

**_Target freshmen._** Upperclassmen already have a ton of commitments; freshmen want to be a part of something big. They want to be a part of a community that’s changing the world. 

  

You can give them that. 

  

That said, people who have proven they can close fundraising are rare. Snatch them up ASAP. Fundraising will very likely be your number one bottleneck until the weekend of your event.

  
  

## Hire fast, Fire Fast.

You need to make sure everyone on your team has the right mindset going into the hackathon. 

  

The most common mindset you need to dispel is that as a organizers you’re doing a service for hackers. Instead, team members should be asking _how do you give hackers a 5 star experience?_ After all, they are your users.

  

Fight informational asymmetry. The biggest risk is that you don’t know someone dropped the ball until the week of the event.

  

If you have **transparency** throughout your team, it’s really easy to see who isn’t getting shit done. **Don’t be afraid to fire** these people. That doesn’t always mean kicking them off the team, but you need to find someone else to take on their responsibilities right away.

  

## **_The team, the team, the team_**

  

More than anything, hackathons are defined by their organizing teams. You could have the most radical mission, but if you don’t have the right team, you won’t execute. 

  

Carry the team on your back. Run headfirst guns blazing into the hardest work. Have fun.

  

**The team is everything.**
