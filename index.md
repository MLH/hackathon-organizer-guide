## 1 Month Before

### Get Final Headcount

Work to confirm a solid headcount. Having this will help you when making food and swag orders. Generally, events see a 30-50% attrition rate, so make sure you consider this in your planning.

### Organize Transportation

If your venue is free, transportation and travel reimbursements are often the most expensive part of putting on a hackathon. After reviewing the information below, watch our short [transportation webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGKX_koCPIk) to ensure your transportation planning runs smoothly. While many hackers have come to expect some sort of funded transportation, it is not required in order to put on a successful hackathon.

#### Charter Buses

Charter buses are typically the most affordable option for getting hackers to and from your event. Keep in mind as you plan that most buses fit 56 attendees, and the average cost per weekend is $3,300 (based on 31 hackathons in Spring 2014). Your hackathon date matters as well: for example, bus prices are often higher in April because so many schools charter them during that month for class trips.


1. **Determine how many seats you’ll need**

* Reach out to student leadership at participating schools to find out how much interest there is in a bus. Have your contact create a Facebook event with the bus boarding time and ask them to invite as many people from the school that they want to.

* Some interested students won’t show up when it’s time to board; we recommend ordering one 56-seat bus per 70 "yeses"

* Dishing out seats on a first come, first serve often works best

**2. Create a travel itinerary**

* Exact locations of pick-up and drop-off points

* Contact info for a point person at the destination and arrival locations

* Trip duration and distance

**3. Collect quotes**

* Use [BusRates.com](http://www.busrates.com/) to sort bus companies by number of buses available, number of seats, bus ages, and cost. We recommend only requesting quotes from companies with 4 star ratings or above.

* [Sharethebus](https://www.sharethebus.com) allows you to organize buses to your event in a central dashboard and request quotes directly from bus companies. They also will help you compare and find the cheapest bus company. The companies on Sharethebus are pre-vetted so you don't have to worry about ratings.

* Questions to ask

    * How much will tip, tolls, hotels, fuel, and taxes cost?

    * Can the company provide proof of insurance and  US D.O.T numbers?

* Create a quote spreadsheet for each route and every company you requested info from. Include company name, price, contact info, number of buses available, etc.

#### Travel Reimbursements

Occasionally, you will need to issue travel reimbursements for some or all of your attendees. A few tips:

* Email attendees via a service like SendGrid or MailChimp with instructions about how to claim their reimbursements. Include a clear timeline with receipt due dates.

* Upload receipts (Wufoo is a good resource). All should clearly show price and date of purchase to qualify.

* Send reimbursements (Venmo is 25 cents per transaction)

* Keep all receipts for tax purposes

#### MLH Tips

* Local bus companies are usually much cheaper than national ones because national companies typically sublease from local companies. (So there’s a markup)

* Adding stops to a route doesn’t cost more money

* Plan for buses to arrive 30 min before pick-up time and stay 15 mins after drop-off

* Bus companies like to send email spam. When soliciting quotes, use a bus-only email address to keep your inbox clean.

* Don’t be cheap. Watch the Transportation Webinar below to hear some stories about why it’s important to pay for quality buses

**ORDER SUPPLIES AND BOOK VENDORS**

Ordering supplies and services a month before the event ensures you’ll have wiggle room to select the best prices and allow for shipping time.

**T-shirts**

* $8 to $10 per head for American Apparel, or $4 to $6 for a cheaper brand

**Food**

* 24-hour event: 4 to 5 meals

* 36-hour event: 6 meals

* To determine how much food you need, multiply $7 per meal x the number of meals x per head of expected attendance. Add $5 to $10 per person for snacks and drinks depending on length of your hackathon.

* Food is a great opportunity to showcase what makes your city special and celebrate any special themes you might have. Use it as an opportunity to share local cuisine that your participants are sure to remember.

* Develop a plan to Donate leftovers to homeless shelter

**Tables and chairs**

* Assume 4-6 people per table depending on how large the tables are.

* Plan on having enough table and chairs for the maximum number of attendees you expect.

**AV equipment**



* For opening ceremony and final demos, plan on having access to a room that can fit all of your attendees seated with a projector.

### Create Your Schedule

Schedules can definitely change, but it’s good for participants (and organizers) to know what to expect. Please, send us your schedule and we can help ensure it’s realistic.

Decide whether to do a 24 -hour or 36-hour hackathon. Then take a look at example schedules to see what makes the most sense for you.

All schedules include:

* Keynote opening speech

* Expo activities like sponsors demo, carnival, networking (2 to 3 hour window)

* Hacking

* Meals and snacks

* Activities (past examples: laser tag, cup stacking competition)

* Judging - If you have multiple judging phases, be sure to block out enough time for each of them with some buffer time in between

#### MLH Tips

* Send your schedule to MLH to ensure it’s realistic

* Encourage sponsors to show up earlier to set-up

### Update Website With Final Info

Ideally, you’ve been updating your site on a rolling basis as more information and sponsorships are finalized. About a month before, you want to

* Schedule

* Set up single channel of communication for day-of updates

* Survey:

  * Name

  * Email

  * Phone number

  * Dietary restrictions

  * T-shirt size

  * Will they need charter bus or travel reimbursement (does this jibe with transportation timeline?)

  * Liability waiver

### Finalize Your Emergency Plan

You should be hoping for the best but planning for the worst. Spend some time coming up with emergency/nightmare scenarios and build up a document with [contingency plans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_plan). This document should also include emergency contact numbers and other vital information. Some examples of these scenarios include:

* A fire starts in your venue.

* Too much power gets used and a fuse in the building gets tripped.

* A hacker has a medical emergency.

* Someone is caught trying to steal something expensive like networking equipment.

The list goes on, and you should have instructions on how each one should be handled. Make sure all volunteers have access to the document, and having a physical copy of it on-site can be helpful.

In terms of emergency contacts, you should include campus security, the local non-emergency police number (not 911) for situations that are not time-critical, and all of your main organizers, along with the times they will be available on-site.

You should also notify local emergency services that you will be hosting a large event with a lot of students not from your school. They should have some protocol for large events and will ideally have a person on-site or on call through the duration of the event.

It is impossible to prepare for every possible scenario, so if something unexpected happens, remember to stay calm, try to isolate the issue, and resolve it with a level head. **Make sure at least one member of your organizing team is awake and alert at all times.**

## 1 Week Before

### Send Reminders

A week before your hackathon is the perfect time to remind everyone involved about what needs to happen. Be sure

* Attendees  — Send clear directions about when and where to report. Include transportation info.

* Sponsors — Sponsors also need clear directions about when and where to report. However, they should be at your venue well before attendees.

* Volunteers and fellow organizers — confirm all volunteer sign-up and designated duties. Send clear directions about when and where to report.

* Vendors  — confirm all times, quantities, and services

* Judges and speakers

Info needed from people: name, email, school, under 18, gender, dietary restrictions, special needs, tshirt size, transp

### Do A Run-through

Just like a play or a wedding, it’s important to rehearse your schedule once with all team members.

* Create and distribute a run-of-show document with:

* A timeline including the official hackathon schedule and a secondary staff schedule denoting what needs to happen behind the scenes — and when

* Confirmed roles and report times for each team member. Sample responsibilities include:

    * Checking in guests

    * Greeting and directing attendees

    * Running social media

    * Setting out food

    * Managing transportation

    * Guiding and attending to sponsors and press

    * Running AV

    * Restocking supplies and picking up garbage

Any others?

* Physically walk-through the run-of-show document in the event space.

#### MLH Tips

* Keep in mind most organizers, especially team leaders, will be responsible for more than one thing

* Hackathon schedules inevitably change. The social media point person should be in charge of communicating schedules updates via Twitter and updates to the Facebook invite as soon as they happen, as well as answering attendee questions in real time.

* Assign at least one organizer to make sure the event is going well and put out fires as needed

#### Resources

* [Example volunteer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y1rf6p97pmmu5mx/PRINT-StudentHackRules.docx?dl=0)

* *If you have minors attending your event you must consult with your venue, school administrators, and/or a lawyer to make sure all necessary paperwork is taken care of*

## Day Of Event

### Brief Volunteers

Make your volunteers responsible for specific tasks. They should be working on something relevant at any given time during their shifts.

### Set-up Your Event

* Set up tables and chairs

* Make sure WiFi is working (or set it up)

* Check power at every table (may need to lay cable)

* Check-in station

* Sponsor and swag area

* Hackathon space

* Speaking area

* Judging space

* Hardware room or table (MLH)

* Food area

* AV and tech

* Relaxation area (if providing)

* Help desk/info center

* "Meditation room"

### Have Organizers Handle The Following Tasks During The Corresponding times:

**Serve breakfast?**

**Welcome and brief sponsors**

**Welcome and check in attendees**

* Check ID, collect liability waivers and minor forms

* GIve out promotional materials

* Give attendees wrist bands or name tags

**Opening ceremony**

* Round up people to attend presentation

* Welcome address

    * Announcements

    * Keynote speaker

    * MLH talks

Note about speakers: Your attendee’s time is valuable. Many sponsors are going to ask for speaking spots… optimize for interesting speakers rather than lucrative speakers.

Invite-only API demos (developer evangelists) are another good option.

(simultaneously)

* Set up first meal

* Find your team/workshop mixer

(meals every six hours including snacks)

During Hacking

* Collect garbage

* Tech talk facilitator: rounding people up to listen and handling speakers (tech talks usually sponsors)

* One volunteer should be in charge of each special area or activity at the hackathon: for example, the hardware room, photo booth, etc.

* Checking in on hackers: feeding them snacks, making sure their power and WIFI are working, etc.

Hacking Deadline

* Get teams to to submit what they’ve been working on to either HackerLeague or Challenge Post. It’s important that every team member is registered on the platform and added to the hackathon project.

* MLH Tip: Announce a deadline that is an hour before your real deadline

* Have an organizer ask each team if they submitted their idea.

* If you have science fair style judging, have hackers go eat lunch in a separate room while you reconfigure the hacking area for demos

### Run Social Media

On the day of the hackathon, social media will play a critical role in communicating hackathon news and schedule updates to attendees. Make sure to designate ONE channel of communication for all updates so every attendee knows where to find important info.

* Regular tweets

* Updates to the FB invite if necessary

### Kick Off Your Hackathon

* Checking in guests

* Greeting and directing attendees

* Running social media

* Setting out food

* Managing transportation

* Guiding and attending to sponsors and press

* Running AV

* Restocking supplies and picking up garbage

#### MLH Tips

* When setting up, [position the sponsor tables next to the hackers. Having the mentors literally next to the hackers makes it really easy for people to ask them for help and for the sponsors to feel as if they are part of the event](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014).
