# Organizer Timeline

## 4 To 9 Months Before

### Lock Down A Venue

Few of your planning decisions will truly make or break your hackathon, but your choice of venue is one of them. It often takes more time than expected to secure the right location, so the earlier you begin scouting, the better! Having a confirmed venue will also prove to potential sponsors and attendees that you’re serious about hosting a great event.

Keep in mind your venue should be **free**! Most of the time, you *will* be able to find a university or company sponsored space. 

#### Research Venues On Your Campus

On-campus venues are best because they’re usually free. Research past events at your school to get a sense of each available space’s capabilities. Do they meet your hackathon’s requirements? Make a list of your favorites.

Note: Each venue usually has one university bureaucrat in charge of it; try to find out who that is. One shortcut is to contact students who previously held events at that space and ask them how they recommend you proceed.

#### Enlist A Campus Advocate To Help You Navigate The Bureaucracy

A university advocate — such as a professor or dean — can make your venue search immeasurably easier by helping you navigate your school’s unique booking process.

In many cases, this person will be your organization’s advisor. If you need to recruit an ally, learn how to sell your event. [You should have a quick elevator pitch that everyone on your organizing committee can give ("No, we will not be breaking into your bank account. Actually a hackathon is…"). Find something your administration understands, and relate a hackathon to that.](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014)

We have created two guides for school administrators. These guides explain what a hackathon is, why it is beneficial for a school, and why it is beneficial for students. It also includes various resources that will be useful for university advocates to use to convince other faculty members. The guides are available [here](http://news.mlh.io/hackathon-guides-for-parents-and-administrators-09-10-2015).

In a short email to potential advocates, you can include:

* A brief definition of a hackathon. (We like to explain it as weekend long invention competition)

* [The guide](http://news.mlh.io/hackathon-guides-for-parents-and-administrators-09-10-2015)

* Video and/or photos of past events

* 3 or more reasons students will *directly benefit* from an on-campus hackathon

[Position your hackathon as a recruiting event with a twist. Odds are, your school already has a career fair and you can position your event on those terms. This immediately aligns your event with your school’s goals.](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014)

**_Note: What to do if you can’t find an on-campus location?_**

On rare occasions, students aren’t able to find a free on-campus venue. If that’s the case, you still have options:

* Research venues in your city or town that have held events of similar size: other hackathons, meetups, etc. If you know someone who put on one of the events, ask for an introduction to the decision maker.

* Approach multiple companies at once that stand to gain something by sharing their space with you, such as a tech company that recruits programmers and designers. Your short email should include the same information you sent to potential on-campus advocates:

* A brief definition of a hackathon. (Unless it’s a tech company, of course.)

* Video and/or photos of past events

* 3 or more reasons students will *directly benefit* from an on-campus hackathon

Big Fat Warning: Whenever possible, don’t fall into the trap of paying to rent a venue. It could easily double the cost of your hackathon. In addition to the rental fee, you will be responsible for providing all of the infrastructure required to run a large event, including Internet wiring, table and chair rental, and possibly your own security team.

If you really can’t find a free venue, look into renting a coworking space with most of this infrastructure in place.

#### Make Sure Your Venue Has Everything You Need

Before you book an event space, make sure it has everything you need help you host a successful hackathon. 

* **Enough capacity** — The average first MLH hackathon is around 300 student hackers. Can the venue accommodate the number of attendees you plan to host?

* **The right physical space** — Your venue must have space for attendees to hack and listen to speakers, as well as designated areas for hardware, food, sponsors, and MLH.

* **WiFi** — Can the WiFi support a large number of people in a condensed space? It should be able to handle 4 devices per attendee. See more info [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NRs6pM0mEetgIFJVvPr5pN5O3diOuTKuhbGZkWMb87c/edit).

* **Power** — Is there enough amperage for hundreds of computers, phones, and hardware devices? (Assume at least 2.5 devices per participants.)

* **AV equipment and staff**— What AV equipment is available? Does the space offer staff to help you set it up?

* **Tables and chairs** — How many seats and tables do you need? Does the venue provide them, or do you need to rent from an outside vendor?

* **Food**— Does the venue offer catering? If it does, are you required to use it? How much will this cost?

* **Accessibility** — Can hackers in need of physical accommodation conveniently access the building? Can hackers who need to sleep during the hackathon find a safe place to do so? (If there is a fire code regulation you should allocate resources to set up a “relaxation” or “meditation” room for small numbers of hackers to rest overnight.)

* **Security** — Will there be a secure space where sponsors, organizers, and attendees can keep their expensive equipment?

If your venue does not have some of these things, but you're on-campus, you may be able to work with other parts of your administration to get them. For example:

* Talk to your school's IT department about fortifying WiFi during your event or renting access points and switches. This can sometimes be done for free or with a security deposit. If you have a supportive administration, they may also come in and help you set it up.

* If you don't have access to the venue's fuse box, talk to the school's electricians to see if you can get special access or have one of them on site/on call.

* If you don't have enough extension cords or power strips, other organizations on campus may have them and be willing to lend them out. e.g. the organization that runs your school's career fair.

#### Ask About Venue Requirements And Restrictions

Most venues come with their own specific list of rules and required fees. A few questions to ask:

* Will any prices you are being quoted for be guaranteed not to exceed a certain maximum estimate?

* Does the building require you to pay for catering, security, a fire marshal, janitors, etc.?

* Does the venue have a loading dock for deliveries?

* Are there specific security regulations you must abide by?

* Are you permitted to host an overnight event? It’s important to let the potential venue know that people will be working in the space overnight. The key word here is "working" -- in many instances, it is against fire code to allow attendees to sleep. (You can always set up a “relaxation” or “meditation” room for small numbers of hackers to rest overnight.)

#### MLH Tips

* Book early!

* Watch out for hidden fees and venue restrictions and requirements.

* Your venue should be free! Do everything in your power to ensure you don’t have to deal with the cost and logistical headache of paying for a space and everything that comes with it.

* Negotiate to reserve your venue for the day before so you have plenty of time to set up. 

* Make sure your space is aware you will be hosting an overnight event.

## 4 Months Before

### Build A Killer Leadership Team

Every first-rate hackathon has an exceptional leadership team behind it. When selecting yours, think like a startup CEO: choose enthusiastic and smart people with complementary skills. Here’s what a hackathon leadership team looks like:

* Head of logistics — books venue, develops and runs schedule, orders services and supplies

* Head of finance — secures sponsorships, makes sure vendors get paid, and manages the cash flow and budget.

* Head of marketing — promotes event. In charge of marketing strategy, website, social media, etc.

* Head of hacker experience - this could be the responsibility of another member of the team, but it is extremely important to have everyone in your organization thinking about how to create the best possible hacker experience at your event.

#### MLH Tips

* To avoid confusion and increase efficiency, make *one person* responsible for each category of deliverables.

* To accurately track progress, encourage transparency among team leaders. Consider creating a status spreadsheet that each person can update on a daily or weekly basis.

#### Resources

* Video: [Team Recruitment and Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSOxWVdJhHg)

* Article: [The First Step in Planning a Successful Hackathon](https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/the-first-step-in-planning-a-successful-hackathon-6cd4f8bd25a2)

### Set Up A Placeholder Website

Until an event has a website, it doesn’t exist to most people. Publishing a basic website the second you’ve committed to hosting a hackathon will help you drive interest to it, capture potential attendee email addresses, and answer questions from interested students:

The first iteration of your site should include:

* Dates and venue (if you have them)

* A pre-registration form. (A few good options for this include SendGrid and LaunchRock.)

* A designated email address to answer potential attendees’ questions

* Links to your event’s Facebook page and Twitter account

* A date when visitors should check back for more info

* A page just for sponsors, including:

    * An email address for sponsorship inquiries

    * A basic FAQ about your event to explain things to someone who has never seen or been to a hackathon before. A good FAQ example: [PennApps](http://2015s.pennapps.com/)

#### MLH Tips

* You should update this site on a rolling basis as you land speakers and sponsors, create your schedule, confirm transportation offerings, etc.

* As early as possible, celebrate what differentiates your event [link to marketing section]

#### Resources

* Screenshots of previous placeholder sites (if available)

* Example pre-registration form

* Links to recommended services such as LaunchRock or GitHub Pages?

### Become a MLH Member Event

At MLH, our goal is to give you the tools to throw the best hackathon humanly possible, which is why MLH Member events receive the following benefits: 

* Mentorship and advice

* Introductions to potential sponsors

* Onsite hackathon support

* Hardware

* Event signage 

* Event photography

(You can see the full list [here](https://mlh.io/become-an-official-event). )

The sooner your hackathon gets applies for membership, the more time you’ll have to take advantage of all MLH hookups. To [apply](https://mlh.io/forms/event-sanctioning-request), it must be *at least* 30 days before the event and you should have a confirmed time and location.

* MLH: [Code of Conduct](http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf)

* MLH: [Hardware list](https://mlh.io/hardware-lab)

### Land Sponsorships

It’s nearly impossible to host a serious hackathon without money. That said, landing quality sponsorship is manageable if you break the process into small steps and give yourself plenty of lead time. The more practice you get approaching and negotiating with potential backers, the better you’ll become at the art of fundraising.

One thing to keep in mind as you work your way through this process: sponsors are like investors — they want to see you’re serious before they give you capital. In the same way you wouldn’t approach a VC without a product prototype, don’t reach out to sponsors until you’ve got evidence that your hackathon is well on its way to happening: a confirmed venue and time, pre-registrations from students, etc.

When you’re finished reading this section of the guide, we strongly recommend watching our fundraising webinar: [Raising Sponsorship - A Workshop by MLH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI9NVe2wA5w).

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

### Draft Your Budget

Before you can begin asking for money, get a sense of how much cash you need to pull off your hackathon. Create a [budget template based on estimated costs and your expected number of attendees](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ADKWatCbC3AhBKlyWOtVSqMcD6O6Y3FcwMTZwynPwDA/edit).

Note: We recommend you build in a buffer of $1,000 to $3,000, depending on the size of the event. In our experience, organizers will *always* need this extra money.

#### Helpful Figures

Over the years the we've found the averages costs for major budget items are as follows:

| Item | Cost |
|:-----|:-----|
| Food | $7 per person per meal |
| Snacks & Drinks | $10 per person |
| T-Shirts | $5-8 per person (dependent on volume) |
| Busses | $3,500 per bus |

* Bitcamp’s [Open Source Budget](https://medium.com/bitcampfire-stories/bitcamps-open-source-budget-14a86974b5b2)

### Understand Your Sponsors: Who They Are, What They Want, And How They operate

You’ll be targeting five types of sponsors:

* Financial — Cash for services. Most sponsors fall into this category. 

* Presenting  — Sponsors that co-host or co-brand your event. (Be careful not to give up too much control here.)

* Anchor brands — These companies make you legit in the eye of other sponsors.

* Strategic partners  — Sponsors that help with marketing and promotion; often publications.

* In-kind  — Donor companies. They can contribute hardware, t-shirts, etc.

Sponsors support hackathons for three primary reasons:

* To get real time feedback on their development products, especially APIs

* To raise awareness (or change the perception) of their brand

* To recruit interns and full-time employees, especially during the fall

Sponsors’ top practical concerns:

* Cost per attendee  — sponsors want this to be low, while you want this to be as high as possible while keeping their support. 

* Attendee value

    * Are your hackathon’s attendees a good fit for the company in terms of recruiting, marketing, etc.?

    * How hard is it for companies to reach this audience without your help?

* Who else is sponsoring?

    * Depending on the sponsor, your other backers matter. Some companies prefer to sponsor events their competitors sponsor, whereas others want to ensure they’re the biggest name on your roster.

* Package Value

    * Are they getting their money’s worth?

* The Force (a.k.a.) their gut

    * How do the sponsors feel about your competency: is the event well-organized so far? Have you been professional in all communications?

#### MLH Tips

* Keep mind the person you’re talking with is often not the person who makes the final sponsorship decisions. Make sure all materials you send are as clear as possible to ensure decision makers have enough information to say yes without taking time to contact you. 

* Many company budgets are quarterly. Q1 and Q4 are often the best times to get money because budgets are more flexible.

### Put Together A Sponsorship Prospectus

Before approaching sponsors, create a short info packet with three tiers of sponsorship. [This doesn’t need to be fancy — just explain what a hackathon is and how they can prepare to get the most out of it. You should make it clear what you are providing, and mention a few things sponsors have done at other hackathons that you thought were awesome.](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014)

Your prospectus should include:

* The basics: date, location, number of expected attendees, etc.

* The story behind your event, an introduction to your team, and a note about what you’re trying to accomplish, as well as what makes your event special. What are its differentiating factors? [link to marketing?]

* An overview of available sponsorships — what companies get and how much it will cost them.

    * We recommend including three sponsorship tiers: reasonable, moderate, and expensive. (Any one tier should not comprise more than 25 percent of your budget.)

    * Let companies know custom packages are available.

Be sure to include the following info on *all* materials — we can’t tell you how many times this gets overlooked!

* Event name

* Date

* Location

* Projected attendance

* Website URL

* Contact email and phone 

### The 5-step MLH Sponsorship Process

Once you’ve ascertained how much money your hackathon needs and created your sponsorship materials, you’re ready to embark on the fundraising process.

#### 1. Set Targets And Do Your Research

* Compile a list of potential sponsors:

    * Check out sponsors of previous MLH events

    * Search your network (LinkedIn is a great tool for this)

    * Check in with career services —  which companies sponsor tech job fairs on your campus?

    * Fundraising announcements

#### 2. Get In Touch

* Send a well-crafted, thoughtful email. 

    * Keep it clear and concise. Shorter is better.

    * Don’t attach the prospectus yet —  your goal here is simply to get to the next step: a phone call.

    * Cover the basics —  when, where, why, etc. 

    * Ask for a short phone call on a specific date. 

* Reach out to the decision maker at each company. When in doubt, email the CEO.

* Intros are infinitely better than cold emails. 

* Follow up: don’t worry if you don’t receive a response to your initial email; wait a week and ask again.

#### 3. Have An Exploratory Phone Call

* Make sure the sponsor knows what a hackathon is —  use analogies like comparing it to a science fair

* Ask about success metrics. What did they get from past sponsorships?

* Sell your team and your story. What makes you special?

* Let THEM do all the talking. You’ll figure out what companies most value this way.

* Don’t be afraid to ask their budget. "Given the times you’ve sponsored events similar to this one, what have you spent and what did you get?" 

* Before you hang up, schedule a follow up call.

#### 4. Make A Proposal

* Do this right away. Sometimes it’s as easy as sending over a prospectus with the packages most relevant to that particular company. Other times, you’ll have to put together a custom proposal.

* Make sure to explain why your offerings are a good fit.

* Give your sponsorship deadline.

* Less is more! Choose a uniform color scheme and keep text to a minimum on each slide.

#### 5. Follow Up And Track Your Progress

* Email a week or two later offering to answer questions.

* Track your emails with a CRM, an email service like Boomerang, or plain old Excel.

* When a sponsor says yes, invoice them immediately.

#### Tracking Your Incoming And Outgoing Funds

* Keep in mind that sponsorship money comes in on a rolling basis

* Develop a process for collecting and spending money. Ask about club accounts

* Have one person in charge of maintaining the budget, outstanding invoices, and accounts payable so that they understand when money is coming in and out

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ybgtN2GjTQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### MLH Tips

* Appoint one person to act as the point of contact for all sponsors (most likely your head of finance).

* Target local companies. [Typically sponsors who are located closer will be able to send more company reps, bring more stuff, and relate more to the hackers. ](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014)

* Be willing to negotiate offerings — to a point. It’s important to preserve the integrity of your hackathon.

* If rejected, ask for something else! Many companies that can’t contribute money are happy to send a judge or an onsite mentor.

* Under promise and over deliver so sponsors feel they got the most bang for their buck.

* Make sure you’ve got your taxes under control. We recommend speaking with an accountant.

### Line Up Great Prizes

Prizes are a great way to reward hackers for their hard work. When selecting them, it’s important to [seriously consider why you are giving a prize, what sort of behaviors that prize rewards, and how you can go about motivating those behaviors. No one wants to be seen as a stingy starfish, but prizes say a lot about who you are as a community, why you are there in the first place, and they influence the vibe of your event — big time.](http://news.mlh.io/are-hackathon-prizes-the-worst-thing-since-moldy-sliced-bread-04-18-2014)

### Book Mentors And Judges

You’ll need to recruit a variety of tech experts to mentor your attendees, speak at your event and judge your hackathon. Consider targeting:

* Experts from your school, including professors, deans, and alumni

* Local community leaders

* Reps from local tech companies 

* Tech celebrities who have something to promote (best for bigger events)

Networking tips for recruiting speakers and judges:

* It’s similar to the process of contacting sponsors [link to sponsorship section of guide]

* Consider who you know and who your school knows

* Have department heads reach out for you when helpful

#### A Note About Judges

We recommend selecting judges that have a strong technical aptitude. If you’re planning to do Science Fair Judging and Presentations, your judges for each should be separate. For expo judging, ensure you have a minimum of one judge per thirty participants.

* Networking tips for recruiting speakers and judges

    * It’s similar sponsorship process

    * Consider who you know and who your school knows

    * Have department heads reach out for you 

#### MLH Tips

* Start close to home. Often your best chances at hosting strong speakers will come from personal and school connections.

* Consider recruiting a high-energy MC. [This person will be the face of the event to hackers and sponsors, so having someone who is excited about hacking with some public speaking experience helps hold the entire event together.](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014)

#### Resources

* Article: [How to Judge a Hackathon: Finding the Chosen One](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-judge-a-hackathon-finding-the-chosen-one-05-15-2014)

* Examples of past speakers for different sized hackathons?

FAQ question: "How should I set up the judging process?"

### Schedule Workshops

More info needed. Do you have any advice or materials related to workshops?

* Who leads workshops? Speakers, sponsors, student experts, etc.

* Examples of past workshops. 

* Recommended number depending on number of attendees

### Update Your Website

* Add all new information, including prizes

* Creating an attendee survey form

#### Resources

* Template: attendee survey form

* Example: past sites?

 

### Promote Your Event

When promoting your hackathon, it’s useful to keep in mind that most events have a 50 to 30 percent drop-off in attendance. Given these stats, it’s your goal to over-market and overbook!

#### Tell Your Hackathon’s Story

What’s your hackathon’s "brand?" How is it unique? Why would *you* want to attend?

* The more tailored your message, the better. Make it school-specific.

* Use the same messaging to stay consistent and build momentum

* Highlight hackathon benefits perks and the ease of attending: it’s free of cost, transportation will be provided, etc.

It would be great to include a short case study or example "about us" page from a successful hackathon here to show, rather than just tell, organizers how

 effective branding works.

#### Get The Word Out

* Invite students from other schools to attend

    * Select at least three schools within six hours of your campus

    * Look at schools that have previously hosted MLH hackathons

    * Don’t overlook community colleges — they’re often rife with promising participants

* Reach out to student groups and departments on all campuses

    * Groups: ACM & IEEE, SWE, SHPE, etc.

    * Departments: computer science, design, engineering and applied math, physics

* Speak in-person during the first 5 minutes of relevant classes and student group meetings on your campus. 

    * Explain what it is, why they should care, when and where it’s being held, and how they can get more info. 

* Launch a social media campaign 

    * Make a Facebook event page and twitter account. Invite and connect to all your friends and members of on and off-campus hacker groups. Hackers@ Berkeley example?

    * Ask other hackathons to tweet about you 

    * Consider Facebook ads MIT example?

* Get pre-event press coverage

    * Tell your school’s paper

#### RESOURCES to get potential pre-event coverage in local and tech media

* Reach out to parent groups (more useful for high school hackathons)

    * Share our [Parent Hackathon Guide](https://mlh.io/parent-hackathon-guide) with parent organizations that are interested in hearing about events for their children.

### Get Final Headcount

Work to confirm a solid headcount. Having this will help you when making food and swag orders. Generally, events see a 30-50% attrition rate, so make sure you consider this in your planning.

### Organize Transportation

If your venue is free, transportation and travel reimbursements are often the most expensive part of putting on a hackathon. After reviewing the information below, watch our short [transportation webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGKX_koCPIk) to ensure your transportation planning runs smoothly. While many hackers have come to expect some sort of funded transportation, it is not required in order to put on a successful hackathon.

#### Charter Buses

Charter buses are typically the most affordable option for getting hackers to and from your event. Keep in mind as you plan that most buses fit 56 attendees, and the average cost per weekend is $3,300 (based on 31 hackathons in Spring 2014). Your hackathon date matters as well: for example, bus prices are often higher in April because so many schools charter them during that month for class trips.


1. **Determine how many seats you’ll need**

* Reach out to student leadership at participating schools to find out how much interest there is in a bus. Have your contact create a Facebook event with the bus boarding time and ask them to invite as many people from the school that they want to.

* Some interested students won’t show up when it’s time to board; we recommend ordering one 56-seat bus per 70 "yeses"

* Dishing out seats on a first come, first serve often works best

**2. Create a travel itinerary**

* Exact locations of pick-up and drop-off points

* Contact info for a point person at the destination and arrival locations

* Trip duration and distance

**3. Collect quotes**

* Use [BusRates.com](http://www.busrates.com/) to sort bus companies by number of buses available, number of seats, bus ages, and cost. We recommend only requesting quotes from companies with 4 star ratings or above.

* [Sharethebus](https://www.sharethebus.com) allows you to organize buses to your event in a central dashboard and request quotes directly from bus companies. They also will help you compare and find the cheapest bus company. The companies on Sharethebus are pre-vetted so you don't have to worry about ratings.

* Questions to ask

    * How much will tip, tolls, hotels, fuel, and taxes cost?

    * Can the company provide proof of insurance and  US D.O.T numbers?

* Create a quote spreadsheet for each route and every company you requested info from. Include company name, price, contact info, number of buses available, etc.

#### Travel Reimbursements

Occasionally, you will need to issue travel reimbursements for some or all of your attendees. A few tips:

* Email attendees via a service like SendGrid or MailChimp with instructions about how to claim their reimbursements. Include a clear timeline with receipt due dates.

* Upload receipts (Wufoo is a good resource). All should clearly show price and date of purchase to qualify.

* Send reimbursements (Venmo is 25 cents per transaction)

* Keep all receipts for tax purposes

#### MLH Tips

* Local bus companies are usually much cheaper than national ones because national companies typically sublease from local companies. (So there’s a markup)

* Adding stops to a route doesn’t cost more money

* Plan for buses to arrive 30 min before pick-up time and stay 15 mins after drop-off 

* Bus companies like to send email spam. When soliciting quotes, use a bus-only email address to keep your inbox clean.

* Don’t be cheap. Watch the Transportation Webinar below to hear some stories about why it’s important to pay for quality buses

**ORDER SUPPLIES AND BOOK VENDORS**

Ordering supplies and services a month before the event ensures you’ll have wiggle room to select the best prices and allow for shipping time.

**T-shirts**

* $8 to $10 per head for American Apparel, or $4 to $6 for a cheaper brand

**Food**

* 24-hour event: 4 to 5 meals

* 36-hour event: 6 meals

* To determine how much food you need, multiply $7 per meal x the number of meals x per head of expected attendance. Add $5 to $10 per person for snacks and drinks depending on length of your hackathon.

* Food is a great opportunity to showcase what makes your city special and celebrate any special themes you might have. Use it as an opportunity to share local cuisine that your participants are sure to remember.  

* Develop a plan to Donate leftovers to homeless shelter

**Tables and chairs**

* Assume 4-6 people per table depending on how large the tables are. 

* Plan on having enough table and chairs for the maximum number of attendees you expect. 

**AV equipment**

 

* For opening ceremony and final demos, plan on having access to a room that can fit all of your attendees seated with a projector.

### Create Your Schedule

Schedules can definitely change, but it’s good for participants (and organizers) to know what to expect. Please, send us your schedule and we can help ensure it’s realistic.

Take a look at example schedules to see what makes the most sense for you. Our [sample run of show](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e2B4-AYUU3Y0xFmiTGLYfRosP2IdXxF1Ud5GvGh-6cE/edit?usp=sharing), will help you create a full and complete event schedule.

All schedules include:

* Keynote opening speech

* Expo activities like sponsors demo, carnival, networking (2 to 3 hour window)

* Hacking

* Meals and snacks

* Activities (past examples: laser tag, cup stacking competition)

* Judging - If you have multiple judging phases, be sure to block out enough time for each of them with some buffer time in between

#### MLH Tips

* Send your schedule to MLH to ensure it’s realistic

* Encourage sponsors to show up earlier to set-up

### Update Website With Final Info

Ideally, you’ve been updating your site on a rolling basis as more information and sponsorships are finalized. About a month before, you want to 

* Schedule

* Set up single channel of communication for day-of updates 

* Survey:

  * Name

  * Email

  * Phone number

  * Dietary restrictions

  * T-shirt size

  * Will they need charter bus or travel reimbursement (does this jibe with transportation timeline?)
  
  * Liability waiver

### Finalize Your Emergency Plan

You should be hoping for the best but planning for the worst. Spend some time coming up with emergency/nightmare scenarios and build up a document with [contingency plans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_plan). This document should also include emergency contact numbers and other vital information. Some examples of these scenarios include:

* A fire starts in your venue.

* Too much power gets used and a fuse in the building gets tripped.

* A hacker has a medical emergency.

* Someone is caught trying to steal something expensive like networking equipment.

The list goes on, and you should have instructions on how each one should be handled. Make sure all volunteers have access to the document, and having a physical copy of it on-site can be helpful.

In terms of emergency contacts, you should include campus security, the local non-emergency police number (not 911) for situations that are not time-critical, and all of your main organizers, along with the times they will be available on-site.

You should also notify local emergency services that you will be hosting a large event with a lot of students not from your school. They should have some protocol for large events and will ideally have a person on-site or on call through the duration of the event.
 
It is impossible to prepare for every possible scenario, so if something unexpected happens, remember to stay calm, try to isolate the issue, and resolve it with a level head. **Make sure at least one member of your organizing team is awake and alert at all times.**

## 1 Week Before

### Send Reminders

A week before your hackathon is the perfect time to remind everyone involved about what needs to happen. Be sure

* Attendees  — Send clear directions about when and where to report. Include transportation info.

* Sponsors — Sponsors also need clear directions about when and where to report. However, they should be at your venue well before attendees.

* Volunteers and fellow organizers — confirm all volunteer sign-up and designated duties. Send clear directions about when and where to report.

* Vendors  — confirm all times, quantities, and services

* Judges and speakers

Info needed from people: name, email, school, under 18, gender, dietary restrictions, special needs, tshirt size, transp

### Do A Run-through

Just like a play or a wedding, it’s important to rehearse your schedule once with all team members. 

* Create and distribute a run-of-show document with:

* A timeline including the official hackathon schedule and a secondary staff schedule denoting what needs to happen behind the scenes — and when

* Confirmed roles and report times for each team member. Sample responsibilities include: 

    * Checking in guests

    * Greeting and directing attendees

    * Running social media

    * Setting out food

    * Managing transportation

    * Guiding and attending to sponsors and press

    * Running AV 

    * Restocking supplies and picking up garbage

Any others?

* Physically walk-through the run-of-show document in the event space.

#### MLH Tips

* Keep in mind most organizers, especially team leaders, will be responsible for more than one thing

* Hackathon schedules inevitably change. The social media point person should be in charge of communicating schedules updates via Twitter and updates to the Facebook invite as soon as they happen, as well as answering attendee questions in real time.

* Assign at least one organizer to make sure the event is going well and put out fires as needed

#### Resources

* [Example volunteer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y1rf6p97pmmu5mx/PRINT-StudentHackRules.docx?dl=0)

* *If you have minors attending your event you must consult with your venue, school administrators, and/or a lawyer to make sure all necessary paperwork is taken care of*

## Day Of Event

### Brief Volunteers

Make your volunteers responsible for specific tasks. They should be working on something relevant at any given time during their shifts.

### Set-up Your Event

* Set up tables and chairs

* Make sure WiFi is working (or set it up)

* Check power at every table (may need to lay cable)

* Check-in station

* Sponsor and swag area

* Hackathon space

* Speaking area

* Judging space

* Hardware room or table (MLH)

* Food area

* Checking in on hackers: feeding them snacks, making sure their power and WIFI are working, etc.

Hacking Deadline

* Get teams to to submit what they’ve been working on to either HackerLeague or Challenge Post. It’s important that every team member is registered on the platform and added to the hackathon project.

* MLH Tip: Announce a deadline that is an hour before your real deadline 

* Have an organizer ask each team if they submitted their idea. 

* If you have science fair style judging, have hackers go eat lunch in a separate room while you reconfigure the hacking area for demos

### Run Social Media

On the day of the hackathon, social media will play a critical role in communicating hackathon news and schedule updates to attendees. Make sure to designate ONE channel of communication for all updates so every attendee knows where to find important info.

* Regular tweets

* Updates to the FB invite if necessary 

### Kick Off Your Hackathon

* Checking in guests

* Greeting and directing attendees

* Running social media

* Setting out food

* Managing transportation

* Guiding and attending to sponsors and press

* Running AV 

* Restocking supplies and picking up garbage

#### MLH Tips

* When setting up, [position the sponsor tables next to the hackers. Having the mentors literally next to the hackers makes it really easy for people to ask them for help and for the sponsors to feel as if they are part of the event](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014).

 

## After The Event
