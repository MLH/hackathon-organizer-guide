### Set-up Your Event

* Hackathon space

* Speaking area

* Judging space

* Hardware room or table (MLH)

* Food area

* AV and tech

### Have Organizers Handle The Following Tasks During The Corresponding times:

**Serve breakfast?**

**Welcome and brief sponsors**

**Welcome and check in attendees**

* Check ID, collect liability waivers and minor forms

* GIve out promotional materials

* Give attendees wrist bands or name tags

#### Brief Volunteers

Make your volunteers responsible for specific tasks. They should be working on something relevant at any given time during their shifts.

**Opening ceremony**

* Round up people to attend presentation

* Welcome address

    * Announcements

    * Keynote speaker

    * MLH talks

Note about speakers: Your attendee’s time is valuable. Many sponsors are going to ask for speaking spots… optimize for interesting speakers rather than lucrative speakers.

Invite-only API demos (developer evangelists) are another good option.

(simultaneously)

* Set up first meal

* Find your team/workshop mixer

(meals every six hours including snacks)

During Hacking

* Collect garbage

* Tech talk facilitator: rounding people up to listen and handling speakers (tech talks usually sponsors)

* One volunteer should be in charge of each special area or activity at the hackathon: for example, the hardware room, photo booth, etc.

* Checking in on hackers: feeding them snacks, making sure their power and WIFI are working, etc.

Hacking Deadline

* Get teams to to submit what they’ve been working on to either HackerLeague or Challenge Post. It’s important that every team member is registered on the platform and added to the hackathon project.

* MLH Tip: Announce a deadline that is an hour before your real deadline

* Have an organizer ask each team if they submitted their idea.

* If you have science fair style judging, have hackers go eat lunch in a separate room while you reconfigure the hacking area for demos

### Run Social Media

On the day of the hackathon, social media will play a critical role in communicating hackathon news and schedule updates to attendees. Make sure to designate ONE channel of communication for all updates so every attendee knows where to find important info.

* Regular tweets

* Updates to the FB invite if necessary

### Kick Off Your Hackathon

* Checking in guests

* Greeting and directing attendees

* Running social media

* Setting out food

* Managing transportation

* Guiding and attending to sponsors and press

* Running AV

* Restocking supplies and picking up garbage

#### MLH Tips

* When setting up, [position the sponsor tables next to the hackers. Having the mentors literally next to the hackers makes it really easy for people to ask them for help and for the sponsors to feel as if they are part of the event](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014).
