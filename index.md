### Create Your Schedule

Schedules can definitely change, but it’s good for participants (and organizers) to know what to expect. Please, send us your schedule and we can help ensure it’s realistic.

Decide whether to do a 24 -hour or 36-hour hackathon. Then take a look at example schedules to see what makes the most sense for you.

All schedules include:

* Keynote opening speech

* Expo activities like sponsors demo, carnival, networking (2 to 3 hour window)

* Hacking

* Meals and snacks

* Activities (past examples: laser tag, cup stacking competition)

* Judging - If you have multiple judging phases, be sure to block out enough time for each of them with some buffer time in between

#### MLH Tips

* Send your schedule to MLH to ensure it’s realistic

* Encourage sponsors to show up earlier to set-up

### Update Website With Final Info

Ideally, you’ve been updating your site on a rolling basis as more information and sponsorships are finalized. About a month before, you want to

* Schedule

* Set up single channel of communication for day-of updates

* Survey:

  * Name

  * Email

  * Phone number

  * Dietary restrictions

  * T-shirt size

  * Will they need charter bus or travel reimbursement (does this jibe with transportation timeline?)

  * Liability waiver

### Finalize Your Emergency Plan

You should be hoping for the best but planning for the worst. Spend some time coming up with emergency/nightmare scenarios and build up a document with [contingency plans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_plan). This document should also include emergency contact numbers and other vital information. Some examples of these scenarios include:

* A fire starts in your venue.

* Too much power gets used and a fuse in the building gets tripped.

* A hacker has a medical emergency.

* Someone is caught trying to steal something expensive like networking equipment.

The list goes on, and you should have instructions on how each one should be handled. Make sure all volunteers have access to the document, and having a physical copy of it on-site can be helpful.

In terms of emergency contacts, you should include campus security, the local non-emergency police number (not 911) for situations that are not time-critical, and all of your main organizers, along with the times they will be available on-site.

You should also notify local emergency services that you will be hosting a large event with a lot of students not from your school. They should have some protocol for large events and will ideally have a person on-site or on call through the duration of the event.

It is impossible to prepare for every possible scenario, so if something unexpected happens, remember to stay calm, try to isolate the issue, and resolve it with a level head. **Make sure at least one member of your organizing team is awake and alert at all times.**

## 1 Week Before

### Send Reminders

A week before your hackathon is the perfect time to remind everyone involved about what needs to happen. Be sure

* Attendees  — Send clear directions about when and where to report. Include transportation info.

* Sponsors — Sponsors also need clear directions about when and where to report. However, they should be at your venue well before attendees.

* Volunteers and fellow organizers — confirm all volunteer sign-up and designated duties. Send clear directions about when and where to report.

* Vendors  — confirm all times, quantities, and services

* Judges and speakers

Info needed from people: name, email, school, under 18, gender, dietary restrictions, special needs, tshirt size, transp

### Do A Run-through

Just like a play or a wedding, it’s important to rehearse your schedule once with all team members.

* Create and distribute a run-of-show document with:

* A timeline including the official hackathon schedule and a secondary staff schedule denoting what needs to happen behind the scenes — and when

* Confirmed roles and report times for each team member. Sample responsibilities include:

    * Checking in guests

    * Greeting and directing attendees

    * Running social media

    * Setting out food

    * Managing transportation

    * Guiding and attending to sponsors and press

    * Running AV

    * Restocking supplies and picking up garbage

Any others?

* Physically walk-through the run-of-show document in the event space.

#### MLH Tips

* Keep in mind most organizers, especially team leaders, will be responsible for more than one thing

* Hackathon schedules inevitably change. The social media point person should be in charge of communicating schedules updates via Twitter and updates to the Facebook invite as soon as they happen, as well as answering attendee questions in real time.

* Assign at least one organizer to make sure the event is going well and put out fires as needed

* *If you have minors attending your event you must consult with your venue, school administrators, and/or a lawyer to make sure all necessary paperwork is taken care of*

## Day Of Event

### Brief Volunteers

Make your volunteers responsible for specific tasks. They should be working on something relevant at any given time during their shifts.

### Set-up Your Event

* Set up tables and chairs

* Make sure WiFi is working (or set it up)

* Check power at every table (may need to lay cable)

* Check-in station

* Sponsor and swag area

* Hackathon space

* Speaking area

* Judging space

* Hardware room or table (MLH)

* Food area

* AV and tech

* Relaxation area (if providing)

* Help desk/info center

* "Meditation room"

### Have Organizers Handle The Following Tasks During The Corresponding times:

**Serve breakfast?**

**Welcome and brief sponsors**

**Welcome and check in attendees**

* Check ID, collect liability waivers and minor forms

* GIve out promotional materials

* Give attendees wrist bands or name tags

**Opening ceremony**

* Round up people to attend presentation

* Welcome address

    * Announcements

    * Keynote speaker

    * MLH talks

Note about speakers: Your attendee’s time is valuable. Many sponsors are going to ask for speaking spots… optimize for interesting speakers rather than lucrative speakers.

Invite-only API demos (developer evangelists) are another good option.

(simultaneously)

* Set up first meal

* Find your team/workshop mixer

(meals every six hours including snacks)

During Hacking

* Collect garbage

* Tech talk facilitator: rounding people up to listen and handling speakers (tech talks usually sponsors)

* One volunteer should be in charge of each special area or activity at the hackathon: for example, the hardware room, photo booth, etc.

* Checking in on hackers: feeding them snacks, making sure their power and WIFI are working, etc.

Hacking Deadline

* Get teams to to submit what they’ve been working on to either HackerLeague or Challenge Post. It’s important that every team member is registered on the platform and added to the hackathon project.

* MLH Tip: Announce a deadline that is an hour before your real deadline

* Have an organizer ask each team if they submitted their idea.

* If you have science fair style judging, have hackers go eat lunch in a separate room while you reconfigure the hacking area for demos

### Run Social Media

On the day of the hackathon, social media will play a critical role in communicating hackathon news and schedule updates to attendees. Make sure to designate ONE channel of communication for all updates so every attendee knows where to find important info.

* Regular tweets

* Updates to the FB invite if necessary

### Kick Off Your Hackathon

* Checking in guests

* Greeting and directing attendees

* Running social media

* Setting out food

* Managing transportation

* Guiding and attending to sponsors and press

* Running AV

* Restocking supplies and picking up garbage

#### MLH Tips

* When setting up, [position the sponsor tables next to the hackers. Having the mentors literally next to the hackers makes it really easy for people to ask them for help and for the sponsors to feel as if they are part of the event](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014).



## After The Event
