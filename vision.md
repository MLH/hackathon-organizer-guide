# Who/What/When/Where/Why are you throwing a hackathon?
Early decisions will end up defining your hackathon. Once you get started, you’ll be so heads down just trying to make sure your hackathon happens that it’s easy to forget to answer some of these questions. 

We think it’s super important to spend a day with your team thinking about these questions so that everyone is on the same page from the start. 

_Aside: Always be flexible and willing to change._

## Who?

Who are you throwing this hackathon for? 

Are hackathons for existing hackers or are they a factory to turn normal people into hackers? Is your hackathon limited to students at your own college or will you open it up to other universities?

PennApps focuses on bringing together the top hackers from all around the world. Unhackathon wants to build the most fun experience for beginners. MHacks believes the magic happens when you mix the highest potential newbies with the top hackers. There are unlimited possibilities.

**Multi-university hackathons** have many benefits, chiefly that attendees have the opportunity to meet and work with students from other schools. This changes the game for many hackers when they realize they can work with people beyond just their own school. That said, if your hackathon is focused on education and has limited space, maybe it makes more sense to restrict it to your own school.

Opening your hackathon to **HS Hackers** can change the game. This is an unparalleled opportunity to attract the top high schoolers to your university for an amazing experience. The High School Hacker community is thriving and they’ve even taken the win at top hackathons like MHacks and PennApps. That said, many universities have minor policies that you’ll have to work around. 

My general advice is to ask for forgiveness not permission. [With minors, that’s not always the best strategy.](minors.md) 

Everything has it’s tradeoffs but early on you want to think about the audience you’re trying to reach and what sort of experience you want them to have. The rest of your decisions going forward will be guided by your hackathon’s unique style and philosophy.

## What?

All hackathons are not created equal. 

What makes your hackathon different? How is it unique? 

Now that hackathons are taking the world by storm, hackers have many different options, so it’s critical to differentiate and specialize. 

Is your hackathon going to be known as the place to build your sickest hardware hacks or is it going to be a mobile app paradise? Maybe you’ll even do a throwback and focus on web/desktop apps. The possibilities are endless but once you’ve answered “Who” you should ask those people what they want.

## When?

There are a few different philosophies with regards to when you should throw a hackathon. 

In general, the earlier the better. 

That said, now that there are multiple hackathons going on every weekend, you should consult the Hackathon Season schedule to find out ideal dates so that you do not overlap with our events in your region: [http://mlh.io/events](http://mlh.io/events)

Hackathons hosted early in the semester avoid exams.

Hosting your hackathon later in the semester gives you time to learn from previous hackathons. Also, momentum builds throughout Hackathon Season, so it may become more advantageous 

Definitely take your team to another hackathon as yours approaches. Offer to volunteer. Take notes. It’s significantly easier to identify where things may go wrong before your event rather than on-the-fly. If you want your team to feel more comfortable under pressure, throwing a hackathon later in the semester of academic year definitely makes sense.

Winter presents a whole host of tradeoffs, especially if you have buses coming in from other schools. Expect delays -- buses and flights will inevitably be affected by the weather. If you go to a school in the South, throwing a hackathon in Winter could give you a huge advantage. Students want to travel away from the cold to sunny, warm places. 

Figuring out potential dates early on is super important. It’s tough to raise funding or book a venue (the two most time-sensitive aspects of organizing a hackathon) until you have a date. You’ll often have to be flexible on date to get the best venues. Sponsors and attendees tend to be more flexible with the dates of your event than venue managers are.

Competing with other hackathons in your region puts a drain on potential sponsors, mentors, and attendees. That said, demand for hackathons is through the roof right now so it’s not the end of the world if you’re on the same weekend as another hackathon -- in fact, it’s more and more likely inevitable.

If you’re thinking about throwing a 500 person hackathon next year, start with a 100 person event this semester. Throwing your second event will be infinitely easier. It’s not a zero sum game. Throwing a hackathon this semester will just get people more excited about the bigger event next semester.

Don’t wait. Throw your first hackathon now. 

## Where?

Do you want to throw your hackathon in conjunction with your school...outside of your school to have more flexibility? 

Location and venue are important early decisions to make.

Schools generally have venues that are free or cheap to use. Leverage these, but understand that many times it comes at a cost -- universities tend to want some control over the event. In the past, this has caused issues for many hackathons so make sure you build a strong relationship and maintain really effective communication with the faculty members making decisions here. You’d be surprised how flexible universities can be when you build relationships with the right people.

Another thing to consider: some venues have specific caterers you have to use. Make sure you calculate this into the cost of the venue as this tends to cost more since you can’t shop around for as many competing quotes.

## Why?

Why are you throwing this hackathon anyways? What’s your vision?

When things aren’t working out (a sponsor falls through, director leaves the team to focus on school, etc.) you need to know why you are doing this to pull your team through. There are so many points in time where any hackathon could just fall apart and not happen at all. We see it all the time. Fortunately, we’ve seen teams with a strong vision succeed against all odds over and over again.

Focusing on metrics like signups and money raised is important, but it’s not enough. Throwing a great hackathon is a lot of work and you need to have some core motivation to draw on to do the impossible. Your vision plays out in everything you do. 

Here are a few examples: 

- Show the world that anything is possible in a weekend by bringing the top hackers together and having the best hacks.  
- Make social impact by encouraging hackers to solve real-world problems.  
- Kickstart the hacker community at your school by inspiring people to build things. 
- Teach people to code in a weekend by welcoming newcomers and surrounding them with a strong mentorship program. 

Hackathons have tons of benefits. Figure out the specific metrics of success that matter to your team. There are many opinions on what you should focus on -- you can read a few different philosophies here: [link -- need to find more but right now I have hackathons aren’t about the hacks]

From your emails, facebook posts, and tweets to the way you run admissions, your vision will end up defining your hackathon. Make sure everyone on the team sees it.

Hackathons can change the world.

**How will yours?**
