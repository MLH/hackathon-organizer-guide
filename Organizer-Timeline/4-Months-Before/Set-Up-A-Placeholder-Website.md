# Set Up A Placeholder Website

Until an event has a website, it doesn’t exist to most people. Publishing a basic website the second you’ve committed to hosting a hackathon will help you drive interest to it, capture potential attendee email addresses, and answer questions from interested students:

The first iteration of your site should include:

* Dates and venue (if you have them)

* A pre-registration form. (A few good options for this include SendGrid and LaunchRock.)

* A designated email address to answer potential attendees’ questions

* Links to your event’s Facebook page and Twitter account

* A date when visitors should check back for more info

* A page just for sponsors, including:

    * An email address for sponsorship inquiries

    * A basic FAQ about your event to explain things to someone who has never seen or been to a hackathon before. A good FAQ example: [PennApps](http://2015s.pennapps.com/)

## MLH Tips

* You should update this site on a rolling basis as you land speakers and sponsors, create your schedule, confirm transportation offerings, etc.

* As early as possible, celebrate what differentiates your event [link to marketing section]
