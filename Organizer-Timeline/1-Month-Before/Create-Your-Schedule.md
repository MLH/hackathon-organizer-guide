# Create Your Schedule

Schedules can definitely change, but it’s good for participants (and organizers) to know what to expect. Please, send us your schedule and we can help ensure it’s realistic.

Decide whether to do a 24 -hour or 36-hour hackathon. Then take a look at example schedules to see what makes the most sense for you.

All schedules include:

* Keynote opening speech

* Expo activities like sponsors demo, carnival, networking (2 to 3 hour window)

* Hacking

* Meals and snacks

* Activities (past examples: laser tag, cup stacking competition)

* Judging - If you have multiple judging phases, be sure to block out enough time for each of them with some buffer time in between
