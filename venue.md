## Having a bad venue is the easiest way for your hackathon to fail.

Hackathons generally stretch for 24-48 hours. That’s a long time. **If your venue sucks, people will leave.**

**Grab a venue ASAP**

As soon as you find a suitable venue, book the date. 

Initially, do this without signing anything that binds you. After you book a venue, never stop looking for an even better one. If you find a better venue, you can almost always cancel with the initial choice without a problem. 

**_Make a list of potential venues right now._** This is the most time-sensitive part of organizing a hackathon. It’s also the easiest place to fail. 

You’ll want to crowdsource this, so ask your friends where the sickest hackathon spaces will be. Maybe even post a facebook status.

## What makes a good hackathon venue?

While having rooms for teams that want to hack alone is nice, **your largest central hacking space will quickly become the epicenter of energy.** Keeping the energy up nonstop here is crucial. Some hackathons even bring in DJs to spin through the night.

Optimally, you’ll have a large central hacking space in addition to smaller side rooms both for teams that want to work in isolation and people who want to take naps/meditate. 

## WiFi

**WiFi is the easiest thing to get wrong.** It’s really expensive to rent or install new infrastructure. 

Consider the fact that most venues haven’t experienced even close to the load that your hackathon will place on their WiFi infrastructure. If they tell you that the wifi will hold, they are most likely wrong, so make sure to do your research.

Most hackers have multiple devices. On top of their laptop and smartphone, many hackers will have an extra device or two. It’s unlikely your venue has experienced the density of devices your hackathon will bring. 

Even if you have plenty of bandwidth, the density of devices can take down most routers. _We commonly run up against the device limits of routers._

## Power

Power is essential and a hacking space isn’t complete unless you can plug in your entire team right where you’re sitting. Hackers often bring their own monitors too.

**Make sure you have enough plugs.** Power strips are a must. We recommend against daisy-chaining, but hackathons often employ this tactic to make outlets more available.

Though accessibility tends to be the main problem, we’ve run up against power limits at several hackathons already. 

If you’re throwing a hackathon in a stadium or sports complex, get in touch with whoever runs the power for the venue ASAP. **Most stadiums aren’t prepared to power anything at a large-scale** except their lights and television screens. CalHacks ordered generators so that they wouldn’t blow Memorial Stadium’s power.

## Comfort

On top of solid power and wifi, a good hackathon venue has comfortable seats and tables, bright lights, and at least one big hacking room. 

People will be here for unnatural amounts of time. **Don’t underestimate the importance of comfortable chairs.** At MHacks III in Detroit, everyone was sitting in $1200 chairs and it made a world of a difference. Even the hacks were better because of it.

**Having bright lights and a big hacking room is crucial.** _People feed off the energy at a hackathon to do things they previously thought were impossible in a weekend._ Though some hackers like to find smaller spaces to hide away and hack, many people leverage the fact that everyone around them is hacking to motivate them to keep going. 

## How to get a venue

To convince a venue to let you throw a hackathon **you’ll likely have to work your way up the bureaucracy to someone who can break the rules.** 24/7 weekend events aren’t standard for most venues, so make sure you’re contacting venues around your area starting now. 

You’ll likely have to do some convincing.

One of the best places to start is by reaching out to the president/reps of your student body and asking them if they can suggest venues/introduce you to the Dean in charge of student activities. 

  
You can change just about anything about a hackathon on the fly, but **you’re stuck with your venue.** If there’s anything you want to make sure to get right from the start, it’s your venue.
