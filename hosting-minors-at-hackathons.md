Opening your hackathon to [HS Hackers][hs hackers] can change the game. This is an unparalleled opportunity to attract the top high schoolers to your university for an amazing experience. The [High School Hacker community][hs hackers] is thriving and they’ve even taken the win at top hackathons like MHacks and PennApps. That said, many universities have minor policies that you’ll have to work around. 

My general advice is to ask for forgiveness not permission. With minors, that’s not always the best strategy. Having anyone at your event under 18 carries additional liability. Given the nature of the weekend-long event, at the least, you should make sure you have parental consent. [Liability waivers](liability.md) are a great way of doing this so that you hit two birds with one stone. 

Some universities have strict policies against hosting minors at all. A loophole that some hackathons have used to get around this is if they attend or take classes at another university.
